For a restaurant logo QR code meant to be printed on a brown bag, you'll want colors that contrast well with brown, are visually appealing, and maintain good QR code scannability.\n\n### Color Suggestions\n\n- **Background:** A light, creamy beige or off-white works well since it'll contrast with the brown bag but keep a \"natural\" feel. Example: `#FAF3E3` (hex).\n- **Foreground (QR color):** A rich, dark color that pops against beige and brown. Here are some stylish food-themed options:\n  - Deep Olive Green: `#4B5320` (evokes nature/food).\n  - Espresso Brown: `#3B2210` (cafe/restaurant vibe).\n  - Terracotta Red: `#B64926` (warm, inviting, and food-friendly).\n\nFor maximum readability, avoid low-contrast combos and overly light QR modules.\n\n#### Example Combo:\n- **Background:** `#FAF3E3` (creamy beige)\n- **Foreground:** `#4B5320` (deep olive)\n\nWould you like to proceed with this combo and a sample QR text like `https://restaurant-app.example.com`?

Brown paper bags are usually a lighter, kraft brown—somewhere between tan and light brown, **not very dark**.
